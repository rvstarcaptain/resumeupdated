5.WHAT ARE ATTRIBUTES IN HTML?
Ans:
Attributes are the addition to element like they denotes the behaviour of the element which shows how the particular element shows up
Attributes are of different type 
They works as a modifier to element
Multiple Attributes can be applied to single element provided each shud have proper syntax with spaces and lowercase
Attributes are case sensitive
Example:
h1   style= “color:red; width:20px“>style and width is the attributes here /h1

6.WHAT ARE DATA- ATTRIBUTES GOOD FOR?
Ans:
It works as a extra property to html element 
It is used to store custom data in private to the page or application
It is of two types
1.Data type name= must be atleast one cgaracter long no capital letters prefix with data
2.data type value=any string

7.DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN &SCRIPT>,  SCRIPT ASYNC AND SCRIPT DEFER>.
Ans;
Scripts are the haveiour than html they take long to download.
Before to download any html element if there is any script tag present it blocks the other tags and element before it gets loaded others element can’t load
Scripts are of 2 types 
Async
Defer
(both used for external scripts they will be ingnored if script tag has no src)
defer scripts shows and tell the page not to wait for scripts and runs the element 
if we use more then one defer case then they wait for each other no matter which property is loaded first
for example:-
script defer src=script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/long.js?speed=1script
script defer src=script defer src="https://javascript.info/article/script-async-defer/small.js?speed=1script
If long.js loads first it though wait for small.js
Async
It doesn’t wait for each other the difference is that only

8.WHY IS IT GENERALLY A GOOD IDEA TO POSITION CSS LINK>S BETWEEN HEADHEAD&> AND JS SCRIPTS JUST BEFORE BODY>? DO YOU KNOW ANY EXCEPTIONS?
Css is used to style the property and so does the head is allocated to give the behaviour to the element
As script has nothing to do with the styling part and we knows that it is haviour to load the dom what placed after this so to be on safe side script is used at the end of the body part before to close the body tag to show up the element in great manner without any issue.
